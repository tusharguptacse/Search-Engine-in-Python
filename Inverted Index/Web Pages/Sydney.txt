and the prime minister of australia the sydney area has been inhabited by indigenous australians for at least 30,000 years the first british settlers led by captain arthur phillip arrived in 1788 to found sydney as a penal colony the first european settlement in australia since convict transportation ended in the mid-19th century the city has transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre as at june 2015 sydney estimated population was 4.92 million in the 2011 census 34 percent of the population reported having been born overseas representing many

features include sydney harbour the royal national park and the royal botanic gardens man-made attractions such as the sydney opera house sydney tower and the sydney harbour bridge are also well known to international visitors   the first people to inhabit the area now known as sydney were indigenous australians having migrated from northern australia and before that from southeast asia radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the sydney area from around 30,735 years ago however numerous aboriginal stone tools were found in western sydney gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years bp which would indicate that there was human settlement in sydney earlier than thought the earliest british settlers called them eora people eora is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the british its literal meaning is from this place prior to the arrival of the british there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in sydney from as many as 29 different clans sydney cove from port jackson to petersham was inhabited by the cadigal clan the principal language groups were darug guringai and dharawal the earliest europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing using trees for bark and food collecting shells and cooking fish development has destroyed much of the city history including that of the first inhabitants there continues to be examples of rock art and engravings located in the protected ku-ring-gai chase national park the first meeting between the native people and the british occurred on 29 april 1770 when lieutenant james cook landed at botany bay on the kurnell peninsula and encountered the gweagal clan he noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement he spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for britain britain—before that england—and ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the atlantic to the american colonies that trade was ended with the declaration of independence by the united states in 1776 overrun with prisoners britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by cook some 16 years earlier the colony was at first to be titled new albion but phillip decided on sydney in recognition of the 1st baron sydney—later created the 1st viscount sydney in 1789—and his role in authorising the establishment of the settlement captain philip led the first fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into botany bay on 18 january 1788 though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water he travelled a short way further north and arrived at port jackson on 26 january 1788 this was to be the location for the new colony phillip described sydney cove as being without exception the finest harbour in the world the official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 february 1788 between 1788 and 1792 about 4,300 convicts were landed at sydney the colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity maps from this time show no prison buildings the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land the region indigenous population was also suffering it is estimated that half of the native people in sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789 some mounted violent resistance to the british settlers lachlan macquarie became governor in 1810 macquarie did make the most of less than ideal circumstances his first task was to restore order after the rum rebellion of 1808 against the previous governor conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade such as wool helped to lessen the burden of isolation macquarie undertook an extensive building programme of some 265 separate works roads bridges wharves and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and come 1822 the town had banks markets and well-established thoroughfares part of macquarie effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens the year 1840 was the final year of convict transportation to sydney which by this time had a population of 35,000 the municipal council of sydney was incorporated in 1842 and became australia first city gold was discovered in the colony in 1851 and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money sydney population reached 200,000 by 1871 following the depression of the 1890s the six colonies agreed to form a federated nation of the commonwealth of australia under the reign of queen victoria federation of the six colonies occurred on 1 january 1901 sydney with a population of 481,000 then became the state capital of new south wales the great depression of the 1930s had a severe effect on sydney economy as it did with most cities throughout the industrial world for much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed construction of the sydney harbour bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing 1,400 men between 1924 and 1932 the population continued to boom despite the depression and reached 1 million in 1925 when britain declared war on germany in 1939 australia too entered during the war sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy far from mass unemployment there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles sydney harbour was attacked by the japanese in may and june 1942 with a direct attack from japanese submarines with some loss of life households throughout the city had built air raid shelters and performed drills following the end of the war the city continued to expand there were 1.7 million people living in sydney at 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975 the people of sydney warmly welcomed queen elizabeth ii in 1954 when the a reigning monarch stepped onto australian soil for the first time to commence her australian royal tour having arrived on the royal yacht britannia through sydney heads her majesty came ashore at farm cove sydney iconic opera house was opened in 1973 by her majesty a strong rivalry between sydney and melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day sydney exceeded melbourne population in the early twentieth century and remains australia largest city the 2000 summer olympics were held in sydney and became known as the best olympic games ever by the president of the international olympic committee the opera house became a world heritage site in 2007 sydney is a coastal basin with the tasman sea to the east the blue mountains to the west the hawkesbury river to the north and the woronora plateau to the south the inner city measures 25 square kilometres 10 square miles the greater sydney region covers 12,367 square kilometres 4,775 square miles and the city urban area is 1,687 square kilometres 651 square miles in size sydney spans two geographic regions the cumberland plain lies to the south and west of the harbour and is relatively flat the hornsby plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys the flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew it was not until the construction of the sydney harbour bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated seventy beaches can be found along its coastline with bondi beach being one of the most famous the nepean river wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the hawkesbury river before reaching broken bay most of sydney water storages can be found on tributaries of the nepean river the parramatta river is mostly industrial and drains a large area of sydney western suburbs into port jackson the southern parts of the city are drained by the georges river and the cooks river into botany bay in 1820s peter miller cunningham described the region west of parramatta and liverpool as a fine timbered country perfectly clear of bush through which you might generally speaking drive a gig in all directions without any impediment in the shape of rocks scrubs or close forest this confirmed earlier accounts by governor phillip who suggested that the trees were growing at a distance of some twenty to forty feet from each other and in general entirely free from brushwood.. the most prevalent plant communities in the sydney region are dry sclerophyll forests which mainly consist of eucalyptus trees and sclerophyll shrubs in the understory sclerophyll forests developed as a result of the extreme age of the continent combined with aboriginal fire use deep weathering of the crust leached chemicals out of the rock leaving australian soils deficient in nutrients the most widespread eucalyptus species within the biome include angophora costata sydney red gum eucalyptus piperita sydney peppermint eucalyptus sieberi silvertop ash eucalyptus oblonga stringybark eucalyptus capitellata brown stringybark corymbia gummifera red bloodwood eucalyptus racemosa scribbly gum and eucalyptus haemastoma scribbly gum most common shrub species include but are not limited to banksia serrata ceratopetalum gummiferum banksia spinulosa and xanthosia pilosa sydney is made up of mostly triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks the sydney basin was formed when the earth crust expanded subsided and filled with sediment in the early triassic period the sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from broken hill and laid down about 200 million years ago the sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds dotted throughout and it is some 200 metres 656 feet thick the basin sedimentary rocks have been subject to uplift with gentle folding and minor faulting during the formation of the great dividing range erosion by coastal streams has created a landscape of deep gorges and remnant plateaus the sydney basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs beaches and estuaries deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the triassic period in the hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region where sydney now lies the rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours port jackson better known as sydney harbour is one such ria under the köppen–geiger classification sydney has a humid subtropical climate cfa with warm summers cool winters and uniform rainfall throughout the year at sydney primary weather station at observatory hill extreme temperatures have ranged from 45.8 °c 114.4 °f on 18 january 2013 to 2.1 °c 35.8 °f on 22 june 1932 whereas at the sydney airport station extremes have ranged from 46.4 to −0.1 °c 115.5 to 31.8 °f an average of 14.9 days a year have temperatures at or above 30 °c 86 °f in the cbd in contrast the metropolitan area averages between 35 and 65 days depending on the suburb the highest minimum temperature recorded at observatory hill is 27.6 °c 82 °f in february 2011 while the lowest maximum temperature is 7.7 °c 46 °f recorded in july 1868 the weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs sydney experiences an urban heat island effect this makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat in late spring and summer temperatures over 35 °c 95 °f are not uncommon though hot dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster this powerful storm brings gale winds and rapid fall in temperature followed by brief heavy rain and thunder due to the inland location frost is recorded in western sydney a few times in winter autumn and spring are the transitional seasons with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn the rainfall has a moderate to low variability and it is evenly spread through the months though is slightly higher during the first half of the year in late autumn and winter east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall especially in the cbd depending on the wind direction summer weather may be humid or dry with the late summerautumn period having a higher average humidity and dewpoints than late springearly summer in summer most rain falls from thunderstorms and in winter from cold fronts snowfall was last reported in the sydney city area in 1836 while a fall of graupel or soft hail mistaken by many for snow in july 2008 has raised the possibility that the 1836 event was not snow either the city is rarely affected by cyclones although remnants of ex-cyclones do affect the city the el niño–southern oscillation plays an important role in determining sydney weather patterns drought and bushfire on the one hand and storms and flooding on the other associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires these tend to occur during the spring and summer the city is also prone to severe storms one such storm was the 1999 hailstorm which produced massive hailstones of at least 9 cm 3.5 in in diameter the bureau of meteorology has reported that 2002 through 2005 were the warmest summers in sydney since records began in 1859 the summer of 2007–08 however proved to be the coolest since 1996–97 and is the only summer this century to be at or below average in temperatures in 2009 dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards eastern australia the average annual temperature of the sea is above 21 °c 70 °f and the monthly average ranges from 18 °c 64 °f in july to 24 °c 75 °f in january  lieutenant william dawes produced a town plan in 1790 but it was ignored by the colony leaders.sydney layout today reflects this lack of planning the geographical area covered by urban sydney is divided into 658 suburbs for addressing and postal purposes and is administered as 40 local government areas the city of sydney is responsible for 33 of these suburbs all of which are located close to the central business district there are 15 contiguous regions around sydney the cbd canterbury-bankstown the eastern suburbs the forest district greater western sydney the hills district the inner west macarthur the northern beaches the northern suburbs the north shore southern sydney st george sutherland shire and western sydney the largest commercial centres outside of the cbd are north sydney and chatswood in the north parramatta to the west liverpool in the south-west hurstville in the south and bondi junction to the east there has been accelerating commercial development in parramatta since the 1950s as firms serving western sydney have set up regional offices and recognised the region significant residential population mass and cheaper rents the cbd itself extends about 3 kilometres 1.9 miles

in area several localities distinct from suburbs exist throughout sydney inner reaches central and circular quay are transport hubs with ferry rail and bus interchanges chinatown darling harbour and kings cross are important locations for culture tourism and recreation there is a long trend of gentrification amongst sydney inner suburbs pyrmont located on the harbour was redeveloped from a centre of shipping and international trade to an area of high density housing tourist accommodation and gambling originally located well outside of the city darlinghurst is the location of a former gaol manufacturing and mixed housing it had a period when it was known as area of prostitution the terrace style housing has largely been retained and darlinghurst has undergone significant gentrification since the 1980s green square is a former industrial area of waterloo which is undergoing urban renewal worth 8 billion on the city harbour edge the historic suburb and wharves of millers point are being built up as the new area of barangaroo the millers pointbarangaroo development has significant controversy regardless of the 6 billion worth of economic activity it is generating the suburb of paddington is a well known suburb for its streets of restored terrace houses victoria barracks and shopping including the weekly oxford street markets the north shore an informal geographic term referring to the northern metropolitan area of sydney consists of artarmon chatswood roseville lindfield killara gordon pymble and many others the north shore has one of the highest property prices in

considered a region separate to sydney proper the inner western suburbs include balmain was once a working class industrial and mining town but has undergone extensive gentrification the inner west also includes sydney olympic park a suburb created to host the 2000 summer olympics the earliest structures in the colony were built to the bare minimum of standards upon his appointment governor lachlan macquarie set ambitious targets for the architectural design of new construction projects the city now has a world heritage listed building several national heritage listed buildings and dozens of commonwealth heritage listed buildings as evidence of the survival of macquarie ideals in 1814 the governor called on a convict named francis greenway to design macquarie lighthouse the lighthouse and its classical design earned greenway a pardon from macquarie in 1818 and introduced a culture of refined architecture that remains to this day greenway went on to design the hyde park barracks in 1819 and the georgian style st james church in 1824 gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s john verge elizabeth bay house and st philip church of 1856 were built in gothic revival style along with edward blore government house of 1845 kirribilli house completed in 1858 and st andrew cathedral are rare examples of victorian gothic construction from the late 1850s there was a shift towards classical architecture mortimer lewis designed the australian museum in 1857 the general post office completed in 1891 in victorian free classical style was designed by james barnet barnet also oversaw the 1883 reconstruction of greenway macquarie lighthouse customs house was built in 1844 to the specifications of lewis with additions from barnet in 1887 and w l vernon in 1899 the neo-classical and french second empire style town hall was completed in 1889 romanesque designs gained favour amongst sydney architects from the early 1890s sydney technical college was completed in 1893 using both romanesque revival and queen anne approaches the queen victoria building was designed in romanesque revival fashion by george mcrae and completed in 1898 it was built on the site of the sydney central markets and accommodates 200 shops across its three storeys the great depression had a tangible influence on sydney architecture new structures became more restrained with far less ornamentation than was common before the 1930s the most notable architectural feat of this period is the harbour bridge its steel arch was designed by john jacob crew bradfield and completed in 1932 a total of 39,000 tonnes of structural steel span the 503 metres 1,650 feet between milsons point and dawes point modern and international architecture came to sydney from the 1940s since its completion in 1973 the city opera house has become a world heritage site and one of the world most renowned pieces of modern design it was conceived by jørn utzon with contributions from peter hall lionel todd and david littlemore utzon was awarded the pritzker prize in 2003 for his work on the opera house sydney first tower was culwulla chambers on the corner of king street and castlereagh street which topped out at 50 metres 160 feet with the lifting of height restrictions in the 1960s there came a surge of high-rise construction acclaimed architects such as jean nouvel harry seidler richard rogers renzo piano norman foster and frank gehry have each made their own contribution to the city skyline important buildings in the cbd include citigroup centre aurora place chifley tower the reserve bank building deutsche bank place mlc centre and capita centre the tallest structure is sydney tower designed by donald crone and completed in 1981 regulations limit new buildings to a height of 235 metres 771 feet due to the proximity of sydney airport there were 1.5 million dwellings in sydney in 2006 including 940,000 detached houses and 180,000 semi-detached terrace houses units or apartments make up 25.8 of sydney dwellings more than the 12.8 which are semi-detached but less than the 60.9 which are separate houses whilst terrace houses are common in the inner city areas it is detached houses that dominate the landscape in the outer suburbs about 80 of all dwellings in western sydney are separate houses due to environmental and economic pressures there has been a noted trend towards denser housing there was a 30 increase in the number of apartments in sydney between 1996 and 2006 public housing in sydney is managed by the government of new south wales suburbs with large concentrations of public housing include claymore macquarie fields waterloo and mount druitt the government has announced plans to sell nearly 300 historic public

inner suburbs such as paddington the rocks and balmain federation homes constructed around the time of federation in 1901 are located in penshurst turramurra and in haberfield haberfield is known as

regarded for its well-preserved records of indigenous habitation and more than 800 rock engravings cave drawings and middens have been located in the park the area now known as the domain was set aside by governor arthur phillip in 1788 as his private reserve under the orders of macquarie the land to the immediate north of the domain became the royal botanic gardens in 1816 this makes them the oldest botanic garden in australia the gardens are not just a place for exploration and relaxation but also for scientific research with herbarium collections a library and laboratories the two parks have a total area of 64 hectares 0.2 square miles with 8,900 individual plant species and receive over 3.5 million annual visits to the south of the domain is hyde park it is the oldest public parkland in australia and measures 16.2 hectares 0.1 square miles in area its location was used for both relaxation and the grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony macquarie dedicated it in 1810 for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of the town and named it in honour of the original hyde park in london researchers from loughborough university have ranked sydney amongst the top ten world cities that are highly integrated into the global economy the global economic power index ranks sydney number eleven in the world the global cities index recognises it as number fourteen in the world based on global engagement the prevailing economic theory in effect during early colonial days was mercantilism as it was throughout most of western europe the economy struggled at first due to difficulties in cultivating the land and the lack of a stable monetary system governor lachlan macquarie solved the second problem by creating two coins from every spanish silver dollar in circulation the economy was clearly capitalist in nature by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased the maritime and wool industries flourished and the powers of the east india company were curtailed wheat gold and other minerals became additional export industries towards the end of the 1800s significant capital began to flow into the city from the 1870s to finance roads railways bridges docks courthouses schools and hospitals protectionist policies after federation allowed for the creation of a manufacturing industry which became the city largest employer by the 1920s these same policies helped to relieve the effects of the great depression during which the unemployment rate in new south wales reached as high as 32 from the 1960s onwards parramatta gained recognition as the city second central business district and finance and tourism became major industries and sources of employment sydney gross regional product was 337.45 billion in 2013 with the city of sydney responsible for 95.18 billion of this total the financial and insurance services industry accounts for 18.1 of gross product and is ahead of professional services with 9

in 2012 there were 451,000 businesses based in sydney in 2011 including 48 of the top 500 companies in australia and two-thirds of the regional headquarters of multinational corporations global companies are attracted to the city in part because its time zone spans the closing of business in north america and the opening of business in europe most foreign companies in sydney maintain significant sales and service functions but comparably less production research and development capabilities there are 283 multinational companies with regional offices in sydney sydney has been ranked between the fifteenth and the fifth most expensive city in the world and is the most expensive city in australia to compensate workers receive the seventh highest wage levels of any city in the

house price in sydney in march 2014 was 630,000 the primary cause for rising prices is the increasing cost of land which made up 32 of house prices in 1977 compared to 60 in 2002 31.6 of dwellings in sydney are rented 30.4 are owned outright and 34.8 are owned with a mortgage 11.8 of mortgagees in 2011 had monthly loan repayments of less than 1,000 and 82.9 had monthly repayments of 1,000 or more

most important roads in sydney were the nine metroads including the 110-kilometre 68-mile sydney orbital network widespread criticism over sydney reliance on sprawling road networks as well as the

utilisation of public transport for travel to work of any australian capital city sydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the world it was the second largest in the british empire after london with routes covering 291 kilometres 181 miles the internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and consequently more popular leading to the progressive closure of the tram network with the final tram operating in 1961 from 1930 there were 612 buses across sydney carrying 90 million passengers per annum a 12.8-kilometre 8.0-mile light rail network opened in 1997 it links

major shipping port cruise ship terminals are located at sydney cove and white bay as climate change greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for australia sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality since 1995 there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the sydney metropolitan region the development led to the release of the metropolitan air quality scheme maqs which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in sydney allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency especially by world city standards it also has a low level of mass-transit services with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of 10 new nissan leaf electric cars the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in australia electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide gases which contribute to climate change cycling trips have increased by 113 across sydney inner-city since march 2010 with about 2,000 bikes passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday transport developments in the

certification as carbon-neutral in 2008 the city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6 and since 2006 has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20 the city of sydney introduced a sustainable sydney 2030 program with various targets planned and a comprehensive guide on how to reduce energy in homes and offices within sydney by 30 reductions in energy consumption have slashed

growth strategy in which it aims to regular increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather thus lowering city temperatures sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy-efficient the one central park development completed in 2013 is an example of this implementation and design obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times a catchment called the tank stream sourced water from what is now the central business district but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s the botany swamps scheme was one of several ventures during the mid 1800s that saw the construction of wells tunnels steam pumping stations and small dams to service sydney growing population the first genuine solution to sydney water demands was the upper nepean scheme which came into operation in 1886 and cost over £2 million it transports water 100 kilometres 62 miles from the nepean cataract and cordeaux rivers and continues to service about 15 of sydney total water needs dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935 in 1977 the shoalhaven scheme brought several more dams into service the sydney catchment authority now manages eleven major dams warragamba one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world woronora cataract cordeaux nepean avon wingecarribee reservoir fitzroy falls reservoir tallowa the blue mountains dams and prospect reservoir
