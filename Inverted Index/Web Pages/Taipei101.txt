was officially classified as the world tallest in 2004 and remained such until the completion of burj khalifa in dubai in 2009 in 2011 the building was awarded the leed platinum certification the highest award according to the leadership in energy and environmental design leed rating system and became the tallest and largest green building in the world it has the fastest elevator going from the 5th floor to the 87 in 49 to 53 seconds construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004 the tower has served as an icon of modern taiwan ever since its opening the building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and asian tradition its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments the tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes a multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores restaurants and clubs fireworks launched from taipei 101 feature prominently in international new year eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media taipei 101 is primarily owned by pan-government shareholders the name that was originally planned for the building taipei world financial center until 2003 was derived from the name of the owner the original name in chinese was taipei international financial center   taipei 101 comprises 101 floors above ground as well as 5 basement levels it was not only the first building in the world to break the half-kilometer mark in height but also the world tallest building from march 2004 to 10 march 2010 as of 28 july 2011update it is still the world largest and highest-use green building upon its completion taipei 101 was the world tallest inhabited building at 509.2 m 1,671 ft as measured to its height architectural top spire exceeding the petronas towers which were previously the tallest inhabited skyscraper at 451.9 m 1,483 ft the height to the top of the roof at 449.2 m 1,474 ft and highest occupied floor at 439.2 m 1,441 ft surpassed the previous records of 442 m 1,450 ft and 412.4 m 1,353 ft respectively the willis tower had previously held that distinction it also surpassed the 85-story 347.5 m 1,140 ft tuntex sky tower in kaohsiung as the tallest building in taiwan and the 51-story 244.15 m 801 ft shin kong life tower as the tallest building in taipei taipei 101 claimed the official records for the world tallest sundial and the world largest new year eve countdown clock various sources including the building owners give the height of taipei 101 as 508 m 1,667 ft roof height and top floor height as 448 m 1,470 ft and 438 m 1,437 ft this lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a 1.2 m 4 ft platform at the base ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement taipei 101 displaced the petronas towers as the tallest building in the world by 57.3 m 188 ft the record it claimed for greatest height from ground to pinnacle was surpassed by the burj khalifa in dubai which is 829.8 m 2,722 ft in height taipei 101 records for roof height and highest occupied floor briefly passed to the shanghai world financial center in 2008 which in turn yielded these records as well to the burj taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second 197 fts 216 kmh or 134 mph as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding area geology — the building is located just 660 feet away from a major fault line — taipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight mega-columns packed with 10,000 psi 69 mpa concrete outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the building core to those on the exterior these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80 m 262 ft into the ground extending as far as 30 m 98 ft into the bedrock each pile is 1.5 m 5 ft in diameter and can bear a load of 1,000–1,320 tonnes 1,100–1,460 short tons during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed rwdi designed a 660-tonne 728-short-ton steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper at a cost of nt132 million us4 million suspended from the 92nd to the 87th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts its sphere the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125 mm 4.92 in thick welded together to form a 5.5 m 18 ft diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes 7 short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads on 8 august 2015 strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres 39 in – the largest movement ever recorded by the damper the damper has become such a hot tourist attraction the city contracted sanrio to create a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby rich gold cool black smart silver and lucky red were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper baby with its cute all-ages appeal has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website taipei 101 characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes 8 short tons the façade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this façade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95 mm 4 in of seismic lateral displacements without damage the original corners of the façade were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour 169 kmh wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final design double stairstep corner façade architect c.y lee also used extensive façade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these façade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two façade sections among others taipei 101 own roof and façade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the building water needs in july 2011 taipei 101 was certified the world tallest green building under leed standards the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built 1001 and all the new years that follow 1 january 1-01 it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100 a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the building shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in western-style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8 m 26 ft tall at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 600 to 1000 each evening the tower lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum the colors coincide with the days of the week the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the building occupants the park design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the building wind shear taipei 101 like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the tower east entrance a ball at the fountain top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the tower rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or chi from a structure and its occupants placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of chi taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation the original 2004 fiber-optic and satellite internet connections permitted transfer speeds up to a gigabyte per second the double-deck elevators built by the japanese toshiba elevator and building systems corporation telc set a new record in 2004 with the fastest ascending speeds in the world at 60.6 kilometres 37.7 mi per hour 16.83 m 55.22 ft per second or 1010 mmin the speed of taipei 101 elevators is 34.7 percent faster than the previous record holders of the yokohama landmark tower elevator yokohama japan which reaches speeds of 12.5 m 41 ft per second 45.0 kmh 28.0 mih taipei 101 elevators sweep visitors from the fifth floor to the 89th-floor observatory in only 37 seconds each elevator features an aerodynamic body full pressurization state-of-the art emergency braking systems and the world first triple-stage anti-overshooting system the cost for each elevator is nt80 million us2.4 million a 660-tonne 728-short-ton tuned mass damper tmd located between the 87th and 91st floors stabilizes the tower against movements caused by high winds the damper can reduce up to 40 percent of the tower movements the tmd is visible to all visitors on the 87th through 91st floors two restaurants have opened on the 85th floor diamond tony which offers european-style seafood and steak and shin yeh 101 欣葉 which offers taiwanese-style cuisine occupying all of the 86th floor is taiwanese restaurant ding xian 101 din tai fung several international dining establishments and retail outlets also operate in the adjoining mall the multi-story retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores restaurants clubs and other attractions the mall interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements the curled ruyi symbol is a recurring motif inside the mall many features of the interior also observe feng shui traditions the 101st floor is home to a private vip club named summit 101 according to the observatory brochure before 2014 no information about this club was ever made public, in 2014 photos of the exclusive club were shown on tv for the first time a taipei financial center corporation spokesman said that only foreign dignitaries hollywood film actors and high spenders in the

fire protection telecom systems and security related systems according to their website.citation needed 4 is considered an unlucky number in chinese culture so what would have been the 44th floor has been replaced by level 43 with 42a replacing the actual 43 to compensate for the skipped floor number.citation needed there is a freight elevator that facilitates access to every level from b5 to 91 with a button for every floor.citation needed a tenant directory is posted in the first floor lobby from the xinyi entrance as of 1 january 2011 the highest occupied office floor excluding the

between merchants and city government officials initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in taipei 101 business district planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it along with many of the other features used in the design of the building it wasnt until the summer of 2001 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site in the meantime construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2000 a major earthquake took place in taiwan during 31 march 2002 destroying a construction crane at the roof top which was at floor number 47 the crane fell down onto the xinyi road beneath the tower crushing several vehicles and causing five deaths – two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed however an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction work was able to restart within a week taipei 101 roof was completed three years later on 1 july 2003 ma ying-jeou in his first term as taipei mayor fastened a golden bolt to signify the achievement the

percent and recycled water meeting 20–30 percent of the building needs leed certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring water and lighting equipment at a cost of nt60 million us1.8 million estimates show the savings resulting from the modifications would pay for the cost of making them within three years the project was carried out under the guidance of an international team composed of siemens building technologies architect and interior designer steven leach group and the leed advisory firm ecotech international the company applied for a platinum-degree
