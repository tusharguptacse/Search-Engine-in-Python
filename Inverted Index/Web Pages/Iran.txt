and elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 bc the area was first unified by the iranian medes in 625 bc who became the dominant cultural and political power in the region iran reached its greatest geographic extent during the achaemenid empire founded by cyrus the great in 550 bc which at one time stretched from parts of eastern europe in the west to the indus valley in the east making it the largest empire the world had yet seen the empire collapsed in 330 bc following the conquests of alexander the great but reemerged shortly after as the parthian empire under the sassanid dynasty iran again became one of the leading powers in the world for the next four centuries beginning in 633 ad rashidun arabs conquered iran and largely displaced the indigenous faiths of manichaeism and zoroastrianism by sunni islam iran became a major contributor to the islamic golden age that followed producing many influential scientists scholars artists and thinkers the rise of the safavid dynasty in 1501 led to the establishment of twelver shia islam as the official religion of iran marking one of the most important turning points in iranian and muslim history during the 18th century iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the sassanid empire and under nader shah briefly possessed what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time through the late 18th and 19th centuries a series of conflicts with russia led to significant territorial losses and the erosion of sovereignty popular unrest culminated in the persian constitutional revolution of 1906 which established a constitutional monarchy and the country first legislative body the majles following a coup détat instigated by the u.k and the u.s in 1953 iran gradually became closely aligned with the west but grew increasingly autocratic growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 revolution and the establishment of an islamic republic iran is a major

islamic jurists under the concept of a supreme leadership a multicultural country comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups most inhabitants are shia muslims and persian is the official language   the term iran derives directly from middle persian ērān first attested in a 3rd-century inscription at rustam relief with the accompanying parthian inscription using the term aryān in reference to iranians the middle iranian ērān and aryān are oblique plural forms of gentilic ēr- middle persian and ary- parthian both deriving from proto-iranian arya- meaning aryan i.e of the iranians argued to descend from proto-indo-european ar-yo- meaning skillful assembler in the iranian languages the gentilic is attested as a self-identifier included in ancient inscriptions and the literature of avesta,a and remains also in other iranian ethnic names such as alans ossetic ир – ir and iron ossetic ирон – iron historically iran has been referred to as persia by the west due mainly to the writings of greek historians who called iran persis greek περσίς meaning land of the persians as the most extensive interactions the ancient greeks had with any outsider was with the persians the term persisted even long after the persian rule in greece however persis old persian pārśa modern persian pārse was originally referred to a region settled by persians in the west shore of lake urmia in the 9th century bc the settlement was then shifted to the southern end of the zagros mountains and is today defined as fars province in 1935 reza shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name iran as the new york times explained at the time at the suggestion of the persian legation in berlin the tehran government on the persian new year nowruz march 21 1935 substituted iran for persia as the official name of the country opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision and professor ehsan yarshater editor of encyclopædia iranica propagated a move to use persia and iran interchangeably today both persia and iran are used in cultural contexts although iran is the name used officially in political contexts historical and cultural usage of the word iran is not restricted to the modern state proper greater iran irānzamīn or irān e bozorg correspond to territories of the iranian cultural and linguistic zones in addition to modern iran it includes portions of the caucasus mesopotamia anatolia and central asia the earliest archaeological artifacts in iran like those excavated at the kashafrud and ganj par sites attest to a human presence in iran since the lower paleolithic era c 800,000–200,000 bc iran neanderthal artifacts from the middle paleolithic period c 200,000–40,000 bc have been found mainly in the zagros region at sites such as warwasi and yafteh cave.page needed around 10th to 8th millennium bc early agricultural communities such as chogha golan and chogha bonut began to flourish in iran as well as susa and chogha mish developing in and around the zagros region.page needed the emergence of susa as a city as determined by radiocarbon dating dates back to early 4,395 bc there are dozens of prehistoric sites across the iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the 4th millennium bc during the bronze age iran was home to several civilizations including elam jiroft and zayande river elam the most prominent of these civilizations developed in the southwest of iran alongside those in mesopotamia the emergence of writing in elam was paralleled to sumer and the elamite cuneiform was developed since the 3rd millennium bc the elamite kingdom continued its existence until the emergence of the median and achaemenid empires between 3400 bc until about 2000 bc northwestern iran was part of the kura-araxes culture that stretched into the neighbouring regions of the caucasus and anatolia since the earliest 2nd millennium bc assyrians settled in swaths of western iran and incorporated the region into their territories.citation needed during the 2nd millennium bc proto-iranian tribes arrived in iran from the eurasian steppes rivaling the native settlers of the country as these tribes dispersed into the wider area of greater iran and beyond the boundaries of modern iran were dominated by the persian median and parthian tribes from the late 10th to late 7th centuries bc the iranian peoples together with the pre-iranian kingdoms fell under the domination of the assyrian empire based in northern mesopotamia under king cyaxares the medes and persians entered into an alliance with nabopolassar of babylon as well as the scythians and the cimmerians and together they attacked the assyrian empire the civil war ravaged the assyrian empire between 616 bc and 605 bc thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of assyrian rule the unification of the median tribes under a single ruler in 728 bc led to the foundation of the median empire which by 612 bc controlled the whole iran and the eastern anatolia this marked the end of the kingdom of urartu as well which was subsequently conquered and dissolved in 550 bc cyrus the great son of mandane and cambyses i took over the median empire and founded the achaemenid empire by unifying other city states the conquest of media was a result of what is called the persian revolt the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the median ruler astyages and was quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the persians later conquests under cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include lydia babylon egypt parts of the balkans and eastern europe proper as well as the lands to the west of the indus and oxus rivers 539 bc was the year in which persian forces defeated the babylonian army at opis and marked the end of around four centuries of mesopotamian domination of the region with the transition from the neo-babylonian period to the achaemenid period cyrus entered babylon and presented himself as a traditional mesopotamian monarch subsequent achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in mesopotamia at its greatest extent the achaemenid empire included the modern territories of iran azerbaijan armenia georgia turkey much of the black sea coastal regions northeastern greece and southern bulgaria thrace northern greece and macedonia paeonia and ancient macedon iraq syria lebanon jordan israel palestine all significant ancient population centers of ancient egypt as far west as libya kuwait northern saudi arabia parts of the uae and oman pakistan afghanistan and much of central asia making it the first world government and the largest empire the world had yet seen it is estimated that in 480 bc 50 million people lived in the achaemenid empire the empire at its peak ruled over 44 of the world population the highest such figure for any empire in history in greek history the achaemenid empire is considered as the antagonist of the greek city states for the emancipation of slaves including the jewish exiles in babylon building infrastructures such as road and postal systems and the use of an official language the imperial aramaic throughout its territories the empire had a centralized bureaucratic administration under the emperor a large professional army and civil services inspiring similar developments in later empires furthermore one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the mausoleum at halicarnassus was built in the empire between 353 and 350 bc eventual conflict on the western borders began with the ionian revolt which erupted into the greco-persian wars and continued through the first half of the 5th century bc and ended with the persian withdrawal from all of their european territories in the balkans and eastern europe proper in 334 bc alexander the great invaded the achaemenid empire defeating the last achaemenid emperor darius iii at the battle of issus following the premature death of alexander iran came under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire in the middle of the 2nd century bc the parthian empire rose to become the main power in iran and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between romans and parthians began culminating in the roman–parthian wars the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 ce when it was succeeded by the sassanid empire together with their neighboring arch-rival the roman-byzantines they made up the world two most dominant powers at the time for over four centuries the sassanids established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the achaemenids with their capital at ctesiphon the sassanid empire of the late antiquity is considered as one of the most influential periods of iran as iran influenced the culture of ancient rome and through that as far as western europe africa china and india and played a prominent role in the formation of both european and asian medieval art most of the era of both parthian and sassanid empires were overshadowed by the roman-persian wars which raged on their western borders at the anatolia the western caucasus mesopotamia and the levant for over 700 years these wars exhausted both romans and sassanids and led to the defeat of both at the hands of the invading muslim arabs several offshoots of the achaemenids parthians and sassanids established eponymous dynasties and branches in anatolia and the caucasus including the kingdom of pontus the mihranids and the arsacid dynasties of armenia iberia georgia and caucasian albania present-day azerbaijan and southern dagestan the prolonged byzantine-sassanid wars most importantly the climactic byzantine-sassanid war of 602-628 as well as the social conflict within the sassanid empire opened the way for an arab invasion to iran in the 7th century initially defeated by the arab rashidun caliphate iran came under the rule of the arab caliphates of umayyad and abbasid the prolonged and gradual process of the islamization of iran began following the conquest under the new arab elite of the rashidun and later the umayyad caliphates both converted mawali and non-converted dhimmi iranians were discriminated against being excluded from the government and military and having to pay a special tax called jizya gunde shapur home of the academy of gunde shapur which was the most important medical center of the world at the time survived after the invasion but became known as an islamic institute thereafter in 750 the abbasids overthrew the umayyads due mainly to the support from the mawali iranians the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army which was led by the iranian general abu muslim the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a revival of iranian culture and influence and a move away from the imposed arabic customs the role of the old arab aristocracy was gradually replaced by an iranian bureaucracy after two centuries of the arab rule semi-independent and independent iranian kingdoms such as the tahirids saffarids samanids and buyids began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate by the samanid era in the 9th and 10th centuries the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified the blossoming literature philosophy medicine and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization during the period known as the islamic golden age the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries during which iran was the main theater of the scientific activities after the 10th century the persian language alongside arabic was used for the scientific philosophical historical musical and medical works whereas the important iranian writers such as tusi avicenna qotb od din shirazi and biruni had major contributions in the scientific writing the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity and so earlier attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran the iranian shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the epic poet ferdowsi now regarded as the most important figure in iranian literature the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks slave-warriors replacing iranian and arab elements within the army as a result the mamluks gained a significant political power in 999 large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids whose rulers were of mamluk turk origin and longer subsequently under the turkish seljuk and khwarezmian empires these turks had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them the result of the adoption and patronage of persian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition in 1219–21 the khwarezmian empire suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan according to steven r ward mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that iran population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th century following the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256 hulagu khan grandson of genghis khan established the ilkhanate in iran in 1370 yet another conqueror timur followed the example of hulagu establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years in 1387 timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan reportedly killing 70,000 citizens the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian by the 1500s ismail i from ardabil established the safavid dynasty with tabriz as the capital beginning with azerbaijan he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of the greater iran iran was predominantly sunni but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam by which the shia islam spread throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus iran anatolia and mesopotamia as a result thereof the modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan having there the 1st and 2nd highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire led to numerous ottoman–persian wars the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas the great 1587–1629 surpassing their ottoman archrivals in strength and making the empire a leading hub in western eurasia for the sciences and arts the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s which was caused by the internal conflicts the continuous wars with the ottomans and the foreign interference most notably the russian interference the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated soltan hosein in 1722 in 1729 nader shah a chieftain and military genius from khorasan successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran during the reign of nader shah iran reached its greatest extent since the sassanid empire reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus as well as other major parts of the west and central asia and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s his territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750 bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited compared to its preceding dynasties many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto independence and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates however despite the self-ruling they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 out of which aqa mohammad khan emerged founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 in 1795 following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region the russo-persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire as a result of the 19th century russo-persian wars the russians took over the caucasus and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region comprising modern-day dagestan georgia armenia and azerbaijan which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay the area to the north of the river aras among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan eastern georgia dagestan and armenia were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th century as iran shrank many transcaucasian and north caucasian muslims moved towards iran especially until the aftermath result of the caucasian war and the decades afterwards while iran armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated russian territories causing significant demographic shifts around 1.5 million people—20 to 25 of the population of iran—died as a result of the great famine of 1870–1871 between 1872 and 1905 a series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by nasser od din and mozaffar od din shahs of qajar and led to the iranian constitutional revolution the first iranian constitution and the first national parliament of iran were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution the constitution included the official recognition of iran three religious minorities namely christians zoroastrians and jews which has remained a basis in the legislation of iran since then the struggle related to the constitutional movement continued until 1911 when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate on the pretext of restoring order the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come during world war i the british occupied much of western iran and fully withdrew in 1921 the persian campaign commenced furthermore during world war i in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i as a result of ottoman hostilities across the border a large amount of the assyrians of iran were massacred by the ottoman armies notably in and around urmia apart from the rule of aqa mohammad khan the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule in 1921 the qajar dynasty was overthrown by reza khan of the pahlavi dynasty who was the prime minister of iran and the former general of the persian cossack brigade and he became the new shah in 1941 reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi and established the persian corridor a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war the presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation the azerbaijan people government and the republic of mahabad as the soviet union refused to relinquish the occupied iranian territory the iran crisis of 1946 was followed which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states and the withdrawal of the soviets in 1951 mohammad mosaddegh was elected as the prime minister he became enormously popular in iran after he nationalized iran petroleum industry and oil reserves he was deposed in the 1953 iranian coup détat an anglo-american covert operation that marked the first time the us had overthrown a foreign government during the cold war after the coup the shah became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic and iran entered a phase of decades long controversial close relations with the united states and some other foreign governments while the shah increasingly modernized iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police the savak were used to crush all forms of political opposition ayatollah ruhollah khomeini became an active critic of the shah white revolution and publicly denounced the government khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months after his release in 1964 khomeini publicly criticized the united states government the shah sent him into exile he went first to turkey then to iraq and finally to france due to the 1973 spike in oil prices the economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency which caused inflation by 1974 the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation and despite many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste by 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s by the late 1970s many of these people opposed the shah regime and began to organize and join the protests against it the 1979 revolution later known as the islamic revolution began in january 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the shah after a year of strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy mohammad reza pahlavi fled the country and ruhollah khomeini returned from exile to tehran in february 1979 forming a new government after holding a referendum in april 1979 iran officially became an islamic republic a second referendum in december 1979 approved a theocratic constitution the immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began by the 1979 kurdish rebellion with the khuzestan uprisings along with the uprisings in sistan and baluchestan province and other areas over the next several years these uprisings were subdued in a violent manner by the new islamic government the new government went about purging itself of the non-islamist political opposition as well as of those islamists who were not considered radical enough although both nationalists and marxists had initially joined with islamists to overthrow the shah tens of thousands were executed by the islamic government afterward on november 4 1979 a group of students seized the united states embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and citizens hostage after the united states refused to return mohammad reza pahlavi to iran to face trial in the court of the new regime and all but certain execution attempts by the jimmy carter administration to negotiate for the release of the hostages and a failed rescue attempt helped force carter out of office and brought ronald reagan to power on jimmy carter final day in office the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the algiers accords the cultural revolution began in 1980 with an initial closure of universities for three years in order to perform an inspection and cleanup in the cultural policy of the education and training system on september 22 1980 the iraqi army invaded the iranian khuzestan and the iran–iraq war began although the forces of saddam hussein made several early advances by mid 1982 the iranian forces successfully managed to drive the iraqi army back into iraq in july 1982 with iraq thrown on the defensive iran took the decision to invade iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer iraqi territory and capture cities such as basra the war continued until 1988 when the iraqi army defeated the iranian forces inside iraq and pushed the remaining iranian troops back across the border subsequently khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the un the total iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 kia 60,711 mia and 11,000–16,000 civilians killed following the iran–iraq war in 1989 akbar hashemi rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution in 1997 rafsanjani was succeeded by the moderate reformist mohammad khatami whose government attempted unsuccessfully to make the country more free and democratic the 2005 presidential election brought conservative populist candidate mahmoud ahmadinejad to power during the 2009 iranian presidential election the interior ministry announced incumbent president ahmadinejad had won 62.63 of the vote while mir-hossein mousavi had come in second place with 33.75 allegations of large irregularities and fraud provoked the 2009 iranian presidential election protests both within iran and in major cites outside the country hassan rouhani was elected as president of iran on june 15 2013 defeating mohammad bagher ghalibaf and four other candidates the electoral victory of

the north-central portion of the country and the dasht-e lut in the east as well as some salt lakes this is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions the only large plains are found along the coast of the caspian sea and at the northern end of the persian gulf where iran borders the mouth of the arvand river smaller discontinuous plains are found along the

endangered species iran lost all its asiatic lions and the now extinct caspian tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century at least 74 species of iranian wildlife are on the red list of the international union for the conservation of nature a sign of serious threats against the country’s biodiversity the iranian parliament has been showing disregard for wildlife by passing laws and regulations such as the act that lets the ministry of industries and mines exploit mines without the involvement of the department of environment and by approving large national development projects without demanding comprehensive study of their impact on wildlife habitats  iran is divided into five regions with thirty one provinces ostān each governed by an appointed governor ostāndār the

gilan and mazenderan provinces the gilaki and mazenderani languages are widely spoken they both have affinities to the neighboring caucasian languages in parts of gilan the talysh language is also widely spoken which stretches up to the neighboring country of azerbaijan kurdish is widely spoken in kurdistan province and nearby areas in khuzestan many distinct persian dialects are spoken the lurish and lari languages are spoken in southwestern and southern iran the turkic languages and dialects most importantly azerbaijani turkish which is by far the most spoken language in the country after persian are spoken in different areas in iran but are especially widely and dominantly spoken in the provinces of azerbaijan notable minority languages in iran include armenian georgian neo-aramaic and arabic khuzi arabic is spoken by the arabs in khuzestan and the wider group of iranian arabs circassian was also once widely used by the large circassian minority but due to assimilation over the many years no sizable number of circassians speak the language anymore percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate as many opt that they are politically motivated most notably regarding the largest and second-largest ethnicities in iran the persians and azerbaijanis the following percentages are according to the cia world factbook 53 persian 16 azerbaijani turkish 10 kurdish 7 mazenderani and gilaki 7 luri 2 turkmen 2 balochi 2 arabic and 2 the remainder armenian georgian neo-aramaic and circassian as with the spoken languages the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups the persians and azerbaijanis due to the lack of iranian state censuses based on ethnicity the cia world factbook has estimated that around 79 of the population of iran are a diverse indo-european ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of the iranian languages with persians incl mazenderanis and gilaks constituting 61 of the population kurds 10 lurs 6 and balochs 2 peoples of the other ethno-linguistic groups make up the remaining 21 with azerbaijanis

mazenderanis gilaks and talysh people azerbaijanis 16 kurds 7 lurs 6 baluchi 2 turkic tribal groups such as qashqai 1 and turkmens 1 and non-iranian non-turkic groups such as armenians georgians assyrians circassians and arabs less than 3 it determined that persian is the first language of at least 65 of the country population and is the second language for most of the remaining 35 other non-governmental estimations regarding the groups other than the persians and azerbaijanis roughly congruate with the world factbook and the library of congress however many scholarly and organisational estimations regarding the number of these two groups differ significantly from the mentioned census according to many of them the number of ethnic azerbaijanis in iran comprises between 21.6–30 of the total population with the majority holding it on 25.cd in any case the largest population of azerbaijanis in the world live in iran historically proto-iranian religion and the subsequent zoroastrianism and manichaeism were the dominant religions in iran particularly during the median achaemenid parthian and sassanid empires this changed after the fall of the sassanid empire

periods iranian art encompasses many disciplines including architecture painting weaving pottery calligraphy metalworking and stonemasonry the median and achaemenid empires left a significant classical art scene which remained as basic influences for the art of the later eras the art of the parthians was a mixture of iranian and hellenistic artworks with their main motifs being scenes of royal hunting expeditions and investitures the sassanid art played a prominent role in the formation of both european and asian medieval art which carried forward to the islamic world and much of what later became known as islamic learning such as philology literature jurisprudence philosophy medicine architecture and science were of sassanid basis there is also a vibrant iranian modern and contemporary art scene with its genesis in the late 1940s the 1949 apadana gallery of tehran which was operated by mahmoud javadi pour and other colleagues and the emergence of artists such as marcos

khayyám ney-shapuri and nezami ganjavi historically iranian literature has inspired writers including johann wolfgang von goethe henry david thoreau and ralph waldo emerson iranian philosophy originates to indo-iranian roots with zarathustra teachings having major influences according to the oxford dictionary of philosophy the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the indo-iranians dating this event to 1500 bc the oxford dictionary also states zarathushtra philosophy entered to influence western tradition through judaism and therefore on middle platonism while there are ancient relations between the indian vedas and the iranian avesta the two main families of the indo-iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences especially in their implications for the human being position in society and their view of man role in the universe the cyrus cylinder which is known as the first charter of human rights is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by zarathustra and developed in zoroastrian schools of the achaemenid era the earliest tenets of zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the zoroastrian religion in the avestan language among them are treatises such as the shikand-gumanic vichar denkard zātspram as well as older passages of avesta and the gathas iranian
