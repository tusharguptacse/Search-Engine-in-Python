243 an emerging market is a country that has some characteristics of a developed market but does not meet standards to be a developed market this includes countries that may become developed markets in the future or were in the past the term frontier market is used for developing countries with slower economies than emerging the economies of china and india are considered to be the largest according to the economist many people find the term outdated but no new term has gained traction emerging market hedge fund capital reached a record new level in the first quarter of 2011 of 121 billion the four largest emerging and developing economies by either nominal or ppp-adjusted gdp are the bric countries brazil russia india and china the next five largest markets are south korea though considered a developed market mexico indonesia turkey and saudi arabia iran is also considered an emerging market   in the 1970s less developed countries ldcs was the common term for markets that were less developed by objective or subjective measures than the developed countries such as the united states western europe and japan these markets were supposed to provide greater potential for profit but also more risk from various factors this term was thought by some to be politically incorrect so the emerging market label was created the term is misleading in that there is no guarantee that a country will move from less developed to more developed although that is the general trend in the world countries can also move from more developed to less developed originally brought into fashion in the 1980s by then world bank economist antoine van agtmael the term is sometimes loosely used as a replacement for emerging economies but really signifies a business phenomenon that is not fully described by or constrained to geography or economic strength such countries are considered to be in a transitional phase between developing and developed status examples of emerging markets include many countries in africa most countries in eastern europe some countries of latin america some countries in the middle east russia and some countries in southeast asia emphasizing the fluid nature of the category political scientist ian bremmer defines an emerging market as a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets the research on emerging markets is diffused within management literature while researchers including george haley vladimir kvint hernando de soto usha haley and several professors from harvard business school and yale school of management have described activity in countries such as india and china how a market emerges is little understood in 1999 dr kvint published this definition emerging market country is a society transitioning from a dictatorship to a free-market-oriented-economy with increasing economic freedom gradual integration with the global marketplace and with other members of the gem global emerging market an expanding middle class improving standards of living social stability and tolerance as well as an increase in cooperation with multilateral institutions in 2008 emerging economy report the center for knowledge societies defines emerging economies as those regions of the world that are experiencing rapid informationalization under conditions of limited or partial industrialization it appears that emerging markets lie at the intersection of non-traditional user behavior the rise of new user groups and community adoption of products and services and innovations in product technologies and platforms more critical scholars have also studied key emerging markets like mexico and turkey thomas marois 2012 2 argues that financial imperatives have become much more significant and has developed the idea of emerging finance capitalism an era wherein the collective interests of financial capital principally shape the logical options and choices of government and state elites over and above those of labor and popular classes julien vercueil recently proposed an pragmatic definition of the emerging economies as distinguished from emerging markets coined by an approach heavily influenced by financial criteria according to his definition an emerging economy displays the following characteristics at the beginning of the 2010s more than 50 countries representing 60 of the world population and 45 of its gdp matched these criteria.10 among them the brics the term rapidly developing economies is being used to denote emerging markets such as the united arab emirates chile and malaysia that are undergoing rapid growth in recent years new terms have emerged to describe the largest developing countries such as bric that stands for brazil russia india and china along with bricet bric eastern europe and turkey brics bric south africa bricm bric mexico mint mexico indonesia nigeria and turkey next eleven bangladesh egypt indonesia iran mexico nigeria pakistan the philippines south korea turkey and vietnam and civets colombia indonesia vietnam egypt turkey and south africa these countries do not share any common agenda but some experts believe that they are enjoying an increasing role in the world economy and on political platforms it is difficult to make an exact list of emerging or developed markets the best guides tend to be investment information sources like emis a euromoney institutional investor company and the economist or market index makers such as morgan stanley capital international these sources are well-informed but the nature of investment information sources leads to two potential problems one is an element of historicity markets may be maintained in an index for continuity even if the countries have since developed past the emerging market phase possible examples of this are south korea and taiwan a second is the simplification inherent in making an index small countries or countries with limited market liquidity are often not considered with their larger neighbours considered an appropriate stand-in in an opalesque.tv video hedge fund manager jonathan binder discusses the current and future relevance of the term emerging markets in the financial world binder says that in the future investors will not necessarily think of the traditional classifications of g10 or g7 versus emerging markets instead people should look at the world as countries that are fiscally responsible and countries that are not whether that country is in europe or in south america should make no difference making the traditional blocs of categorization irrelevant guégan et al 2014 also discuss the relevance of the terminology emerging country comparing the credit worthiness of so-called emerging countries to so-called

before specifically iraq and mongolia there has been disagreement about the reclassification of these countries among others for the purpose of acronym creation as was seen with the brics estimating the demand for products or services in emerging markets and developing economies can be complex and challenging for managers these countries have unique commercial environments and may be limited in terms of reliable data market research firms and trained interviewers consumers in some of these countries may consider surveys an invasion of privacy survey respondents may try to please researchers
