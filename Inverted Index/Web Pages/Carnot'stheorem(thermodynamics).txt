118 carnot theorem developed in 1824 by nicolas léonard sadi carnot also called carnot rule is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs carnot theorem states the formula for this maximum efficiency is where tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir th is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir and the efficiency η displaystyle eta is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir based on modern thermodynamics carnot theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics historically however it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law   the proof of the carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature the heat engine with more efficiency η m displaystyle eta m is driving a heat engine with less efficiency η l displaystyle eta l causing the latter to act as a heat pump this pair of engines receives no outside energy and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir however if η m η l displaystyle eta meta l then the net heat flow would be backwards i.e into the hot reservoir it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the second law of thermodynamics we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure first we must point out an important caveat the engine with less efficiency η l displaystyle eta l is being driven as a heat pump and therefore must be a reversible engine if the less efficient engine η l displaystyle eta l is not reversible then the device could be built but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid by restricting our discussion to cases where engine η l displaystyle eta l has less efficiency than engine η m displaystyle eta m we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols q displaystyle q and w displaystyle w represent non-negative quantities since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where η l ⩽ η m displaystyle eta lleqslant eta m conservation of energy demands that for each engine the energy which enters e i

t displaystyle eout the figure is also consistent with the definition of efficiency as η w q h displaystyle eta wqh for both engines it may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not efficiency w q h displaystyle wqh but the coefficient of performance cop which is q c w displaystyle qcw a reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency w q h displaystyle wqh delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct carnot theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs t 1 displaystyle t1 and t 2 displaystyle t2 must have the same efficiency assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of η displaystyle eta and let the more efficient engine m drive the less efficient engine l as a heat pump as the figure shows this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy which violates the second law of thermodynamics therefore both reversible heat engines have the same efficiency and we conclude that this is an important result because it helps establish the clausius theorem which implies that the change in entropy is unique for all reversible processes over all paths from a to b in v-t space if this integral were not path independent then entropy s would lose its status as a state variable if one of the engines is irreversible it must be the m engine placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible l engine but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine i.e if η m η l displaystyle eta meta l then the second law of thermodynamics is violated and since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine we have the first part of carnot theorem the efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or  η w c
