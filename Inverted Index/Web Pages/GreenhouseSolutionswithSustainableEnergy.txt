396 greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is a 2007 book by australian academic mark diesendorf the book puts forward a set of policies and strategies for implementing the most promising clean energy technologies by all spheres of government business and community organisations greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy suggests that a mix of efficient energy use renewable energy sources and natural gas as a transitional fuel offers a clean and feasible energy future for australia   the book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems and is structured in three sections diesendorf argues that early in his career mark diesendorf was a principal research scientist with csiro where he was involved in early research on integrating wind power into electricity grids this issue is discussed in some detail in greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy diesendorf explains that large-scale wind power is not intermittent because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously in practice the variations in thousands of wind turbines spread out over several different sites and wind regimes are smoothed as the distance between sites increases the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites decreases this has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by graham sinden from oxford university graham sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the united kingdom he found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200 km to 0.25 at 600 km separation a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0 there were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the united kingdom and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the united kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year diesendorf goes on to say that every conventional power station breaks down unexpectedly from time to time causing an immediate loss of all its power that is true intermittency according to diesendorf and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power once a conventional power station has broken down it may be offline for weeks much longer than windless periods dick nichols in green left states that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy brings together much useful material about global warming and possible solutions nichols suggests that if there’s one serious shortcoming in greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy it’s a failure to consistently trace what rate of implementation of energy efficiency and uptake of renewable energy sources is necessary to confront the greenhouse emergency patrick oneill in chain reaction suggests that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems and that the book is simply a joy to read oneill explains that whilst an immense amount of technical and scientific detail is presented the language is simple and the book is well laid out it also covers often ignored areas of the sustainable energy discussion such as population issues morality social justice and equity in conclusion oneill states that the book is a wonderfully energising piece of sedition which calls for a coordinated national strategy for non-violent action george wilkenfield in australian review of public affairs is more critical and suggests the book feels strangely anachronistic partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes wilkenfield explains that this rather misses the point that the continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions is not a byproduct of injustice or repression but of economic freedom in the west and the unrelenting economic growth by which repressive regimes such as china’s buy legitimacy in general very few people want to be freed from consumption—most want the freedom to consume even more wilkenfield goes on to say that diesendorf misses some of the dynamics of consumption energy use gives people comfort speed privacy and convenience many people actually enjoy driving and like their cars and would continue to use them as long as they could afford to even if public transport were available nevertheless in the end wilkenfield concedes that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is very suitable as a textbook or as a handbook for activists journalists or the more committed reader who is not afraid of numbers mark diesendorf teaches and researches ecologically sustainable development and greenhouse solutions at the institute of environmental studies at the university of nsw previously he has been a principle research scientist at csiro professor of environmental science at uts and vice-president of the australia new zealand society for ecological economics
